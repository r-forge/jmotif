#### 1.0 z-Normalization (`znorm(ts, threshold)`)
Z-normalization is a time series preprocessing step proposed Goldin&Kannelakis whose goal is to enable downstream analyses to focus on the time series structural similarities/differences instead of their amplitude.

    x = seq(0, pi*4, 0.02)
    y = sin(x) * 5 + rnorm(length(x))

    plot(x, y, type="l", col="blue", 
      main="A scaled sine wave with a random noise and its z-normalization")

    lines(x, *znorm(y, 0.01)*, type="l", col="red")
    abline(h=c(1,-1), lty=2, col="gray50")
    legend(0, -4, c("scaled sine wave","z-normalized wave"),
      lty=c(1,1), lwd=c(1,1), col=c("blue","red"), cex=0.8)

#### 2.0 Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (i.e., PAA) (`paa(ts, paa_num)`)
PAA reduces the time series dimensionality by averaging values of equal-sized segments of the original time series. In the following example the time series of dimensionality 8 points is reduced to 3 points.

    y = c(-1, -2, -1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0)
    plot(y, type="l", col="blue",
        main="8-points time series and it PAA transform into 3 points")

    points(y, pch=16, lwd=5, col="blue")

    abline(v=c(1,1+7/3,1+7/3*2,8), lty=3, lwd=2, col="gray50")

    y_paa3 = paa(y, 3)

    segments(1,y_paa3[1],1+7/3,y_paa3[1],lwd=1,col="red")
    points(x=1+7/3/2,y=y_paa3[1],col="red",pch=23,lwd=5)

    segments(1+7/3,y_paa3[2],1+7/3*2,y_paa3[2],lwd=1,col="red")
    points(x=1+7/3+7/3/2,y=y_paa3[2],col="red",pch=23,lwd=5)

    segments(1+7/3*2,y_paa3[3],8,y_paa3[3],lwd=1,col="red")
    points(x=1+7/3*2+7/3/2,y=y_paa3[3],col="red",pch=23,lwd=5)

#### 3.0 SAX transform (`ts2string(ts, a_size)`)
Transforms each of the input time series points into a letter. Typically, SAX applied to time series of reduced with PAA dimensionality in order to accelerate the time series search by their indexing in the symbolic space. Before processing with PAA and SAX, time series are usually z-Normalized.

The figure below illustrates the PAA+SAX procedure: 8 points time series is converted into 3-points PAA representation at the first step, PAA values are converted into letters by using 3 letters alphabet at the second step.

    y <- seq(-2,2, length=100)
    x <- dnorm(y, mean=0, sd=1)
    lines(x,y, type="l", lwd=5, col="magenta")
    abline(h = alphabet2cuts(3)[2:3], lty=2, lwd=2, col="magenta")
    text(0.7,-1,"a",cex=2,col="magenta")
    text(0.7, 0,"b",cex=2,col="magenta")
    text(0.7, 1,"c",cex=2,col="magenta")

    > ts2string(y_paa3, 3)
    [1] "a" "c" "c"
